# ISQS-6339-Final-Project

I was trying to break down some of the pieces of the project so we could maybe divide up. Maybe this is helpful. If nothing else, we can use it as a launching point if anyone has something they really want to do. 


# Tasks needed for FCP:
CSV files cleaned and in the same quarterly format so they can be jointed into a larger data set.

### Introduction – 
overview of the project. 
Shows benefits or justifications of project.

## Data domain discussion – 
1) Background of each industry, macro of the environment.
2) Potential directions the industry is moving and how the data might pertain to those movements.

## Analysis of data – Discuss issues related to the data that was gathered. Should address:
1) What data exists (data types, observations, variables, etc.).
2)Sources where the data was found.
3) How are individual variables of the data directly beneficial to the business “what did the team identify as potentially valuable and why”.


## Data cleaning – Discuss overall quality of the data. Should address:
1)What is overall quality of the data.
2)What variables contain missing values/dirty values.
3)How did we address the issues of data quality/missing values/dirty values.
4)What issues did we have in cleaning the data – Talk about bad plans and bad code. What we could have done better.

## Data merging – Discuss methods used to merge the datasets. Should address:
1)How was the data merged.
2)Were there issues related to difference in granularity betweendatasets? How did we address issues?
3)Did we identify any macro-variables that could be created? Variables that come from 2 or more variables between different datasets.
4)Which combinations of variables are now beneficial to the business. How can I benefit the business now that I have variables from 2 different datasets together? 

## Visualization of Data – List the visualizations made. Should address:
1)What insights were gained by visualizing the data?
2)How do the visualizations adhere to the best practices of designing graphs or principle of natural processing?
3)We should have a minimum of 3 graphs.

##Additional documentation – any metrics to carry forward to future courses.

## Flow diagram – (draw.io) 
Should illustrate all steps necessary for the project. Should illustrate what “files” and “language” are being used at each step.

##Instructions for code – Step by step of how to run the code.
